# Ionic 4 Playground

Forked from mharrington, I'm using this project as an ionic 4 playground. I've added ngrx dependencies, althought they're not actually in the code yet.

Personally, I'm pretty excited about ionic 4 becoming more of a UI library, rather than a full front end solution built on top of Angular. In particular, I'm looking forward to using angular routing (because now we can use ngrx/router-store with ionic!) and having a normal webpack build.
